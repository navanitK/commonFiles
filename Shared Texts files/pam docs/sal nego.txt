Thank you for extending the offer to join your esteemed organization as a Senior Salesforce Wizard. I am very excited about the opportunity and have carefully reviewed the compensation structure. I am pleased with the overall offer. Given my extensive experience and Salesforce certifications, I am confident that I will bring substantial value to the team. 
However, I noticed that the health insurance, pension, and 13th Month pay components are missing from the package. I would like to request the addition of a 13th-month salary component. I request we structure the package so that I receive 5K or more Net.

However, I noticed that the health insurance, pension, and 13th Month pay components are missing from the package. I would like to request the addition of a 13th-month salary component. I request we structure the package so that I receive 5K or more Net. with 30% ruling.
This I request because of the inflation in Netherlands and 30% ruling law changes that will bring down non taxed income to 20% and then 10%. 
It will really become a challenge to sutain in Netherlands in that scenario. 
I look forward to your positive response and am open to discussing this matter further if necessary. Thank you once again for this wonderful opportunity. Best regards, [Your Name]
