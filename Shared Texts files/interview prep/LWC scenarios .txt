LWC scenarios : 

1) Account Team History 
created a LWC compoenent to show custom history table for Account team Object. 
Account teams does not have a history table. 
Client wanted to see , who changed the Access for , Account , Opportunity , Case on the Account team and from what level to what level. 

we designed a custom table to manage this and showed the data in tabular format in LWC.

The LWC was places in the Flexi page on the Account related list tab. 

Object , last value, new Value, Modified by , mod date . 

2) Table too Large : 

Case table was grown beyond 300 Fields : 

Solution we created antother table and had one to one mapping between the tables. 
Over ride the View button with a VF page , 
the action was set to redirect to a VF page and we showed details in the VF page. 

you can launch and AURA component from this VF to show the detail view 


3) show multiple Order and Order line items in a single view 

Client wanted a two apge alyout 
	on the left side : see List of orders and when they select 
	opn the right side OLIs from that order need to been seen and sorted by delivery status . 
	
	We made lwc, other option , joined report but client did not like the UI as it was too long of a page and lot of scrolling .
