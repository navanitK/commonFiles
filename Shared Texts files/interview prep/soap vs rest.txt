WSDL definition - smx structure 
soap is the implementation of that structure at run time.  

service consumer asks for WSDL 
wsdl tells data structure for the Request 
then we fire request 
get response from google

every time new param is added to the service , a new wsdl file needs to be published by google. 
every clinent(consumer ) has to update thier code to consume the new WSDL.

when clien t requests calls ;

salesforce library converts the message into Soap envelop 
and send sopa enveloop to Service provider. 

upon the HTTP we will send DATA in an XML , called SOAP envelop.
SOAP envelop will be designed by the run time based on WSDL file. 


REST

Send JSON over HTTP 
so since in JSON everything is an object . and we can add things or remove at run time.
